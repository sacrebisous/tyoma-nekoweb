              <p>
                The afterlife in my setting is reminiscent of the
                <a href="https://aoda.org/publications/articles-on-druidry/threedruidelements/"
                  title="Three Druid Elements, from the Ancient Order of Druids in America">Druidic Three Circles of Manifestation</a
                >. I&#39;ll be referencing it to better explain the hierarchies and layouts of different realms of
                existence. Here&#39;s a basic overview:
              </p>
              <p>
                Modern druids tend to believe that the soul goes through a cycle of reincarnation. The soul passes
                between different states of being as it undergoes a journey towards perfection. The states/realms are as
                follows:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  <strong>Annwn:</strong> The cauldron of soul soup. Where creation is born and where a soul from Abred
                  returns to process what it has learned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Abred:</strong> The physical world where a soul is incarnated. The soul goes from a
                  single-celled organism up to human life in order to absorb new lessons on its existence in the
                  &quot;real world&quot;. The journey is not always linear, and sometimes a human may be later
                  reincarnated as a plant or lower animal if it still has more to learn and process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Gwynfydd:</strong> The heavenly realm that perfected souls go to after fulfilling their
                  journey in the physical realm. The journey still does not end there and they begin going through the
                  cycles of the overworld.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Ceugant:</strong> The infinite, never-ending realm where the divine powers of the cosmos
                  dwell.
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                I&#39;ll mention this again throughout, but in my setting you can consider <strong>Abred</strong> to be
                the Earthly realm, <strong>Gwynfydd</strong> to be Heaven, and <strong>Ceugant</strong> to be the
                dwelling place of First Sphere angels and God.
              </p>
              <h1 id="purgatory-the-waterfall-">Purgatory (the Waterfall)</h1>
              <p>
                Purgatory is the realm that a human soul returns to after death. It is a never-ending forestscape filled
                with plants, but no wildlife whatsoever. When a person enters the forest, they are not able to come into
                contact with any other humans and wander alone.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only way for a soul to escape Purgatory is to go down the waterfall, which they discover when
                seeking an exit. By doing so, they begin their next cycle of reincarnation in the human world. What they
                do before going down the waterfall illustrates the lessons they may or may not have learned from their
                previous life. This can range from environmental interactions, time spent in Purgatory, and their
                emotional state(s). This all determines what their next incarnation will be and what trials they will
                face in the next life.
              </p>
              <h2 id="guardians-of-the-waterfall">Guardians of the waterfall</h2>
              <p>
                Three young women became the guardians of purgatory after their refusal to go down the waterfall. They
                both all died at the same time from suicide, but only settled into their &quot;roles&quot; gradually,
                meeting each other after integrating. Their purpose is to guide lost souls to the waterfall and remind
                them to continue their cycle of reincarnation.
              </p>
              <p>While the three are technically nameless.... I named them for ease of differentiation.</p>
              <p>
                <strong><a href="https://toyhou.se/27674386.fauna" title="Toyhou.se page for Fauna" target="_blank">Fauna</a></strong> has been there the longest and is
                almost like a guardian to the other girls. She is nurturing and kind, but mute. She has long, curly
                brown hair that goes all the way down her back and wears a thin headband. Her previous incarnation died
                from drowning.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong><a href="https://toyhou.se/27674691.juno" title="Toyhou.se page for Juno">Juno</a></strong> arrived second and is the only one
                of the three who speaks. She is quick-tempered and appears to still have a lot to work through from her
                past incarnation. She has wavy black hair styled in shoulder-length cornrow locs. Her previous
                incarnation died in an automobile accident.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong><a href="https://toyhou.se/27674682.noel" title="Toyhou.se page for Noel">Noel</a></strong> is the youngest of the three and is
                only semi-mute, but rarely speaks unless necessary (usually to visitors). She is shy and deeply
                troubled, prone to crying fits after spending too much time alone. She has shoulder-length, straight,
                light brown hair and a thin headband. Her previous incarnation died from the impact after falling from a
                skyscraper.
              </p>
              <h1 id="heaven">Heaven</h1>
              <p>
                <strong>Heaven</strong> is not the traditional afterlife, but the place where angels and all other
                divine/holy beings normally reside. It is a timeless realm where all angels that have ever been and ever
                will be exist at the same time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The angelic hierarchy is based on
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_angels#Christianity" target="_blank" title="Hierarchy of angels on Wikipedia">Pseudo-Dionysus&#39;s classifications</a
                >. Heaven is separated into three different &quot;spheres,&quot; each housing three angelic
                &quot;choirs&quot;. The third and lowest sphere is comprised of Angels, Archangels, and Principalities.
                The second sphere is comprised of Powers, Virtues, and Dominions. The first and highest sphere is
                comprised of Ophanim, Cherubim, and Seraphim. (<a href="https://tyoma.cool/angels" title="Hierarchy of angels">I wrote a somewhat more detailed explanation of Pseudo-Dionysus&#39; hierarchy here.</a
                >) Despite the separation between spheres, higher tiers of angels can freely go to lower spheres. Lower
                tiers will usually need to have some form of authorization to enter higher spheres.
              </p>
              <p>
                God also resides in Heaven but is an immaterial and all-encompassing being. Lower angels don&#39;t
                typically have direct correspondence with God the way a first sphere angel would. However, they can have
                a message passed up to God through higher-ranking angels. Otherwise, since all angels are made of
                God&#39;s light, they can be spiritually guided by God&#39;s will.
              </p>
              <p>
                (Due to certain circumstances at the time the main stories take place, God is absent from Heaven and the
                angels are instead guided by the highest of all angels, Metatron.)
              </p>
              <h2 id="how-angels-work">How angels work</h2>
              <p>
                In this setting, angels are the &quot;perfected&quot; versions of human souls that have completed the
                cycle of reincarnation.. In the Druidic framework, we can say angels are souls that have reached the
                circle of Gwynfydd in Heaven.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not all souls are destined to become angels. Chosen souls have their final angelic vessels, prepared and
                suspended in an endless ocean. Upon completion of their soul&#39;s journey, black-eyed angels called
                Watchers help wake the vessels up. They resurface at the gates of Heaven and are greeted by their divine
                counterpart. They play the role of a soulmate and guide for their new existence in Heaven. Every angel
                is endowed with a divine counterpart at creation.
              </p>
              <p>
                While every angel is created with a specific role in mind, they can move to different choirs. They can
                ascend or descend to certain choirs based on the fulfillment of their duties and/or greater purification
                of their soul. (Remember, even souls in <strong>Gwynfydd</strong> are still striving to reach
                <strong>Ceugant</strong>.) For example, an Angel can ascend to become a Seraphim through their actions.
                A Virtue can choose to become a Dominion if they believe they are better suited to a lower role.
              </p>
              <p>
                Angels do not remember any part of their human lives, but have an innate curiosity and longing to
                understand where they came from before. They are typically urged to avoid setting foot on Earth for any
                reason, as it can reawaken ALL memories from their past lives at once. Because of the toll it can take
                on their minds, they are essentially barred from re-entering Heaven until the Day of Judgement when they
                are enveloped in God&#39;s infinite grace. That being said, they ARE still allowed to visit Earth but
                must exercise caution (i.e. guardian angels).
              </p>
              <h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Seraphim are the only rank of angels allowed to set foot on Earth without receiving spiritual damage,
                  and are thus allowed to return back to Heaven after touching the ground.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The angel Metatron is the only angel who supercedes the regular hierarchy. He is the only primordial
                  angel (i.e. he did not have to go through the regular soul&#39;s journey whatsoever).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The only angels to experience only one human incarnation before ascending to divinity are the
                  Archangels of the sefirah. (NOTE: I&#39;ll explain the sefirah at a later date.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://toyhou.se/27674337.rivka" title="Toyhou.se page for Rivka" target="_blank">Rivka</a> is the only angel to have set foot on Earth and
                  suffered no consequence from it.
                </li>
