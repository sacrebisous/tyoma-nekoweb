      <p class="main">Hello people of online... welcome to <span style="color:red">The Tyoma Zone.</span> Also known as the central hub of all Tyoma (your webmaster!) content. I really miss the olden days when everyone had a website and could make their own site dedicated to whatever they want, rather than having to rely on the Twitters and Tumblrs and Instagrams, and what have you!!! So that's why I made this page! There's gonna be my art, links to my favorite websites, music I enjoy, and more! It's just all a matter of when I end up making a page for it :3!</p>
      <p>For right now the website is indefinitely under construction. But I hope you enjoy exploring what I have on display so far!</p>
