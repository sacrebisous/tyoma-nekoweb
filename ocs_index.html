      <p>*whispers* This guy's crazy! He has way too many characters for one guy to keep track of!</p>
      <p>It's come to my attention that I never ever actually talk about my characters so nobody really knows anything about them aside from a few funny little details. So I'm planning to keep this side of the site semi-updated every so often with new profiles of them! Just click on any of the icons below to be taken to that character's profile page :^)</p>
