      <h1>TYOMA'S ART MENU</h1>
      <p>Well this was a long time coming huh! Welcome, one and all, to this mess of images I can scarcely call a portfolio! This is where I will be <i>attempting</i> to post much of my art, finished and unfinished! Since there's so much to work through, I have devised a little menu for you to click through in case there are specific subjects you would like to peruse...We good? Good! This page is going to be dedicated to some of my favorite works, hope you enjoy it!!</p>
