      <p>This is the part of the site where I show off my collection of links!! The World Wide Web is not what it once was, so I wanna put alot of cool stuff in this area of my website...</p>

      <h5><span style="color:red;">OR TRIGGERING IN SOME WAY SO I'LL TRY TO PUT DISCLAIMERS WHERE NECESSARY.</span></h5>

      <h3><a href="https://www.fallenlondon.com/">Fallen London</a></h3>
      <p>A cool online game I found when watching an Extra Credits video! I'm not sure what to compare it to, but it has vibes of a bizarre steampunky gothic ..... mystery game? Mystery may be a stretch. It's primarily text-based, so you're gonna be reading a lot. Just play it for a bit and see what you think! I think it's neat.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://www.gnod.com/">GNOD - Global Network of Discovery</a></h3>
      <p>This site helps you discover new things you'd like based on things you like already! For example, you can put in names of artists you like (my guys are Hans Zatzka and Jean-Baptiste Greuze) and it'll recommend some more artists for you (I got Asher B Durand, who I actually did a painting study of later...)! So far, it can recommend artists, musicians/bands, movies, and literature. Give it a go if you're itchin' for something new!</p>

      <h3><a href="https://sci-hub.41610.org/">Sci-Hub</a></h3>
      <p>Have you ever been writing an essay and found the perfect source for your paper, but it was unavailable through your school's database and you would have to pay way too much money to read it? Or have you ever just found a cool scholarly article you wanted to read but couldn't due to the paywall! Sci-Hub has got your back! There's instructions online (and I think on this page) for how to access the papers... but all this particular site does is point you to which pages Sci-Hub is currently operating at! Always check here to see which pages are safe to go to if you wanna use this service.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://www.starman2001.com/">STARMAN ZONE</a></h3>
      <p>Home of one of my favorite artist's projects! They have some funky and cool art that I would describe as modern-vintage. Ah, just go check it out yourself! As of last time I checked, you can see the rest of their art <a href="https://twitter.com/fishpilgrim">right over here!</a></p>

      <h3><a href="http://www.windows93.net/"><b>WINDOWS93</b></a></h3>
      <p><i>(Warning for epilepsy)</i> It's like old timey Windows, but not! I haven't explored everything but I really got sucked into Solitaire for a few hours one here the day I discovered it. I can say the epilepsy warning is mainly for the FX application!!! Some of the themes are flashy, so be careful with that one if you are sensitive to flashing lights!</p>

      <h3><a href="https://philome.la/jace_harr/you-feel-like-shit-an-interactive-self-care-guide/play/index.html">You feel like shit - An interactive self-care guide</a></h3>
      <p>Exactly what it says on the tin! This is a nice little resource if you have any mental illnesses, problems & issues, don't practice self care enough or simply forget to take care of yourself some days! I like to refer to this site when I'm not feeling well emotionally or when my executive dysfnuction kicks in. Hopefully it can help you too (if you need it)!</p>

      <h3> <a href="https://myfridgefood.com/">My Fridge Food</a> </h3>
      <p>You ever open your fridge to see it's full of ingredients but not meals? Go to this site and put in what you already have at home and it'll pull up some easy recipes for you to make! It's very helpful for someone like me, who struggles with really bad ADHD :^) Also have heard it's great for making depression meals! Give it a little look-see!</p>
